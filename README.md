## Run the project
1. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. Run `docker-compose up --build` in the project's root directory

Now the service should be ready to use.

### Backend
Backend is available by the address:
`http://localhost:8000/`

Where `8000` is a port that is specified in the `.env` file.
If needed - you can update it there.

#### Dependencies
If you need to add some backend dependencies - you should add them to the `backend/requirements.txt` file

### Frontend
Will be available soon!
